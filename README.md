IEEE Research paper and Final Year Project on Cryptography Communication Security.

### ABSTRACT 

The Cryptography is gotten from a Greek word which implies the craft of ensuring data by changing it into a muddled organization and unreadable format. It is a mix of arithmetic and software engineering. The dynamite growth of the Internet has made an expanded familiarity with intrigue uncertainty issues. Even though security is the measure worries over the internet, numerous applications have been created and structured without considering fundamental destinations of data security that is confidentiality, authentication, and protection. As our day by day exercises become increasingly more dependent upon data networks, the significance of an understanding of such security issues and trouble will also increase. To forestall some undesirable clients or individuals to gain admittance to the data, cryptography is required. .This paper introduces a new hybrid security cipher by combining the two most important Ciphers such as Polybius Cipher and Vigen√®re Cipher. This hybrid encryption cipher provides greater security as compared to classic ciphers.
